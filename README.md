F-Appen is an app that strives to connect the various F-Klub services/systems in a single mobile package.

## Project Environment  
  
To set up a development environment for the project you will need the following setup on your system:  
  
 - Node.JS (Any semi recent version should work - has been tested to work with V17)  
 - A local [stregsystem](https://github.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet) setup. Since the app depends on the API you will need with that implemented (see [stregsystem/#320](https://github.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet/pull/320)).  
  
Running the project:  
  
```bash  
npm install     # Installs dependencies  
npm start       # Builds the project and starts a local server  
```  
  
To just build the project run `npm run build`.
